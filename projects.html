<!-- <p> I work on two different projects which both come under the broad umbrella of experimental nuclear physics. One of it is a hardware project in which I am helping to design and build a detector subsystem and in the other I analyse the collision data from <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/world/"> Brookhaven National Lab </a> to further our understanding about <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color-glass_condensate"> colour-glass condensate </a>. Brief explanation of these projects are given below.

<h2> Building of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) :</h2>

<p>Time projection chamber is a tracking device used in many physics experiments to be able to track energetic particles as they move through a medium. I help in building a tracking device for upcoming detector system <a href="https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/web/"> sPHENIX </a> at BNL. 
Unlike most TPCâ€™s, which have a spatial resolution of 300 microns, we are hoping to achieve a resolution of 150 microns which will be a critical in measuring fully resolved upsilon states and thus the debye radius of <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/riken/research/QGP.php" target="_blank"> quark-gluon plasma </a>. The tracking system will work in continuous read out, at high data collection rates -15kHz- and will be able to provide the needed momentum resolution.

<h2> MPCeX Callibration and Data Analysis:</h2>
