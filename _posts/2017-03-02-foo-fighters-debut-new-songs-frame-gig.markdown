How would you feel if your favorite band sent a special ticket to  your mailbox so you could attend their show in a local venue the next day? well, that's what happened to some lucky Foo Fighters fans in Frome, UK. What a bummer that I wasn't one of them!

Marking the return after *1 year 3, months and 10 days* (Dave'd been counting...) since the last gig, the band played a surprise show at a not-for-profit venue called **Cheese and Grain** and it came with some other surprises.

The **first** one was the announcement that they were headlining <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/71764-foo-fighters-to-headline-glastonbury-2017/" target="_blank">Glastonbury Festival</a> this year. However, the **second** and most exciting one was not announced, it was PLAYED! The band simply teased the crowd with part of a song that the internet has called "Keep Your Pretty Promise to Yourself":

### Keep Your Pretty Promise To Yourself

Moreover, the other song the band decided to give the audience a sneak peek of has been called "Run With Me":

### Run With Me

### New album this year: my theory

The band's website shows <a href="https://foofighters.com/departures/" target="_blank">13 dates</a> where the band is going to play in Europe from June to September and here's my bet: *the band would be playing a show with unreleased songs during these festivals while recording them live to release as their new album*. Thus, the new Foo Fighters' album would probably have 10 to 13 new songs, each of them recorded live in one of these festivals. I might be completely wrong, but I hope I'm not because that would be huge and unique!

My theory comes from the fact that as it was unofficially mentioned that they were going to be recording the new album this year, so it's a bit unrealistic to think that they'd do it after a super intense tour in Europe ending in September. So why not do it while playing all these gigs?

Furthermore, besides the fact that I also don't think this has ever been done before like Dave said, lately the band has openly tried new ideas for their recording process and I wouldn't doubt that this is what they've been planning for this year...we'll see.
