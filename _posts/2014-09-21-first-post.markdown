A couple of years ago, in my first years in college, I had a website just like this one where I would post some information about the creative process of a project that I was working on or even some stuff I thought it would be useful to other people.

#Migrating from Wordpress

Although I was very used to the way Wordpress works, I always felt like it was too much for what I wanted. I needed something faster and straightforward that would help me to create and maintain content as easily as opening my favorite editor and typing my ideas, just like we do when we have that idea and we want to write it down. Fast. Well...I found out about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. and that's exactly what I was looking for.

So now, I even feel like I should share more, write more...do more. Join me throughout the process and feel free to contact me. :)
