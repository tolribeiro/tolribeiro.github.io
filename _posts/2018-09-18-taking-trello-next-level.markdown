Just like a lot of people I know, I've been a Trello user for several years. 

Also, as an Engineer, working on Agile environments and applying the 
Kanban methodology every day (and loving it, btw), I've started to apply some ideas to organize both my personal life and side projects.

So even though the main features of Trello are already good enough for the majority of things, I still missed some key features and they were:

- Identifying cards by ID;
- Set estimation;

Main Idea:
Kanban process implemented with Trello & an add on is good enough to
modest small software projects

Topics
1.Why to use a process like Kanban?
2.What are main tools at our disposal in the industry?
3.What are the considerations for choosing one?
4.If Trello, how is it good enough for a modest size project?
5.How does it look like in practical terms?
6.What would be the potential improvements?
