Just like a lot of people I know, I've been a Trello user for several years. 

Also, as an Engineer, working on Agile environments and applying the 
Kanban methodology every day (and loving it, btw), I've started to apply some ideas to organize both my personal life and side projects.

So even though the main features of Trello are already good enough for the majority of things, I still missed some key features and they were:

- Identifying cards by ID;
- Set estimation;

Main Idea:
Kanban process implemented with Trello & an add on is good enough to
modest small software projects

Topics
1.Why to use a process like Kanban?

One of the most important parts of the process involving the design and analysis of systems is the proper choice of the methodology to be used throughout the implementation phase.

In the case of systems modest in size operating with relatively small teams aiming to release software early and often without having to following the constraints of a more rigid approach, an ideal list of characteristics describing the proper methodology would probably look something like this:

* Little to none distinction amongst roles;

* High flexibility to change;

* Estimation based on from cycle time; 

* Variable prioritization;

In these regards, we are describing Kanban. Added its three main principles (pag 78 kanban in action) a, b, c and we're at a pretty good start to
implement it and reap the benefits of it
