A couple of years ago when I was getting to me second year of college, a couple of friends foud out about this thing called **competitive programming**, and they were all super excited about it. 

They were talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest" target="_blanket">ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</a>, which I would summarize as a "World Cup" of programming where you form a team and try to "score" as much as you can by solving challenging programming problems in a short period of time.

### **My experience with programming contests**

In 2010, I decided to participate in the first phase with two pals from school and other groups of friends that formed teams to compete as well. We decided to go to Federal University of Sergipe in Aracaju, where my friends and I solved 2 out of 10 questions, and with this result we conquered the 4th place

Also, the team of my other friends got 4 and ended up in 2nd, which allowed them to compete the national phase. (!) 

### **Does competitive programming make me a better programmer?**

As time passed and things at school were getting harder, I decided to put this new "thing" aside and dedicate myself fully to my classes...until now.

Not that I think of being a competitor for real or dedicating a lot of energy on this now, but <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2010/04/02/so-you-want-to-become-a-better-programmer-topcoder/" target="_blanket">this article</a> by *John Sonmez* from the `simpleprogrammer.com` made me realize that doing competitive programming problems as a hobby can be a great and *fun* way of starting to make gains again in my programming skills.

### **What is the best platform to solve questions?**

When I participated, my friends and I used to solve questions from <a href="https://uva.onlinejudge.org/">Uva</a>. However, I personally think that <a href="http://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a> is more user-friendly and easier to practice on.

I decided to start solving the <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC" target="_blanket">most solved ones</a> to gain practice again, and until this day I have solved problems <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A" target="_blanket">1A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A" target="_blanket">4A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A" target="_blanket">71A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/A" target="_blanket">158A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/A" target="_blanket">118A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/50/A" target="_blanket">50A</a>,<a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A" target="_blanket"> 231A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/B" target="_blanket">158B</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A" target="_blanket">282A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/96/A" target="_blanket">96A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/116/A" target="_blanket">116A</a>, <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/131/A" target="_blanket">131A</a> and <a href="http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/112/A" target="_blanket">112A</a>. 

This is going to be one of my hobbies throughout the year. I'll be trying to submit as many questions per week as possible so by the end of the year I hope to have something to say about the gains mentioned by John.

Leave your comment if you decide to join this game too and exercise your brain with some programming challenges.
