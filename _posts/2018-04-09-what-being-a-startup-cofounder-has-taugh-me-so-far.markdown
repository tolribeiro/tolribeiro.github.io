It's been almost a year. A year that I've decided to start embracing the journey of providing value to people that I could have never reached from my desk at my job. I've decided to start a startup (ironic).

Besides the fact that I was on the newspaper recently (:eye) and we've had some modest growth and improvements throughout the business model and structure, I think that the best thing that has happened to me during this journey has been the knowledge I've gained.
