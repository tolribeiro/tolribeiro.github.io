It's been almost a year. A year that I've decided to start embracing the journey of providing value to people that I could have never reached from my desk at my job. I've decided to create a startup with some friends (ironic).

Besides the fact that I was on the newspaper recently (:eye) and we've had some modest growth and improvements throughout the business model and structure, I think that the best thing that has happened to me during this journey has been the knowledge I've gained. Putting your face out there isn't easy, but the rewards and growth that come along with it are definitely great starting points to make you act better next time. Not in business only, but in life.

## 1 - Know the WHO and its needs before acting


This one sounds so obvious but yet when it comes to starting a business, it tends to fade out very quickly.

Today I strongly believe that if every step you take with your business is taken guided by external feedback and input, you tend to have more chances of winning. 

In general, we like to fantasize about the fact that we know the solution to a problem and that this mere fact of creating and putting it out there is going to provide value to thousands of people because in your head, it's obvious...right? well...not really. I personally had to learn it the hard way: *nobody really cares* about what you're creating until you've stablished **WHO** is going to use it and more importantly, *why* they would, with real facts and numbers.

## 2 - Be the real medicine, not the bandaid

Have you ever heard someone say something like: "Wouldn't that be cool if there was an app...". Well, being cool doesn't mean it solves a real pain in the life of anyone. I also believe that based on that phrase, thousands of companies have gone down the hill. However, when you're startin something
