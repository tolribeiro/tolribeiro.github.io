**Main Idea:**
Kanban process implemented with Trello & an add on is good enough to
modest small software projects

#### Topics

1. **Why to use a process like Kanban?**

One of the most important parts of the process involving the design and analysis of systems is the proper choice of the methodology to be used throughout the implementation phase.

In the case of systems modest in size, 

operating with relatively small teams, 

aiming to release software early and often without having to follow the constraints of a more rigid approach, 

a list of ideal characteristics describing an approach that fits these requirements would probably look something like this:

* Little to none distinction amongst roles;

* High flexibility to change;

* Estimation based on cycle time; 

* Variable prioritization;

Sounds familiar? well, yes. We are describing Kanban.

4. **If Trello, how is it good enough for a modest size project?**

   - _Talk about the flow of a Jamp project (mention Slack for creating) and introduce Pro4Trello_
   - _Relate the flow with some considerations from 3 and 1._

5. **What would be the potential improvements?**

- _Split card into sub-cards (hour tasking)_
- _Admin view to check state of board_
