Hey there! I'm Thiago and I'm a Computer Engineer. Being born and raised in Brazil (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife" target="_blank">Recife</a>), I now live and work in the beautiful (and cold) city of Chicago, USA.

My passion for computers started with the push of the power button on my very first one: a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gfungXsreQ4/U-sodWDqTTI/AAAAAAAAAcE/LoJ5ssXT8Yc/s1600/p0.jpg" target="_blank">Computer Presario 5520</a> in the early 2000's. From that moment on, I could never get off of a screen. 

I created this website to share some random stuff about myself and my profession. Hope you extract tons of value from this little corner of mine on the web. Questions? just shoot me an <a href="mailto:thiago@toribeiro.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>! :)
