My passion for computers started with the push of the power button on my very first computer: a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gfungXsreQ4/U-sodWDqTTI/AAAAAAAAAcE/LoJ5ssXT8Yc/s1600/p0.jpg" target="_blank">Computer Presario 5520</a> in the mid 2000's. From that moment on, I could never get off of a screen. 13 years later, I officially became a Computer Engineer (more info here).

I created this website to share some random stuff about myself and my profession. Hope you extract tons of value from this little corner of mine on the web. Questions? just shoot me an <a href="mailto:thiago@toribeiro.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>! :)
