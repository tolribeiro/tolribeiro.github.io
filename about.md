It all started with the push of the power button from my very first computer: a Computer Presario 5520. After seeing my friends talk about them at a time where they were pretty much new to everyone, I couldn't help but start bugging my dad to buy me one. And so he finally did.

In the early 2000's, my machine was as slow as a turtle I know; but the simple fact that I could input data into it, interact with its buttons, insert a CD-ROM and connect to the Internet, fascinated me beyond normal. From that year on, to everyone that asked me the classic "what do you want to be..." I would answer: "Computer Engineer". I had no idea about what that meant but my affirmation was certaintly taken into my subconscious mind which guided me through the steps to become a Computer Engineer indeed.

I ended up graduading from University of Pernambuco, Brazil - with part of my major being completed in Chicago (DePaul University and Loyola University Chicago) and in Oklahoma (Oklahoma Christian University), United States.

I can tell you that those years shaped 50% of who I am (you mean a nerd? carinha) whereas the other half came from my passion for music (yes, I'm on Spotify too lol). Important note: as a good Brazilian, soccer and churrasco are ingrained into my bloodstream as well...typical. 

Sem mais delongas, welcome to my little corner in this crazily connected world. I hope you extract tons of value from it. Nice to meet you!

<!-- I am a PhD student in Nuclear Physics at [Stony Brook university](http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/) supervised by Prof. Thomas Hemmick and Prof. Abhay Deshpande. I did my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Elctronics Engineering at [SASTRA University](http://www.sastra.edu/), India. 

I work on a really fun hardware project in which, I help in the design and construction of a [Time Projection Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber) for a proposed [sPHENIX](https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/web/)  detector system. In parallel, I also work on the measurement of direct photons in forward rapidities from d+Au collisions fron run 2016 at Brookhaven National Lab. This measurement allows for strong constraints of nuclear effects related to gluon saturation as well as insight into the physics of the color glass condensate. More details on my research can be found here.

Apart from research, I am very passionate about teaching. Over the last couple of years, I have taught lab courses in Physics for life science undergraduate majors and have volunteered at local elementary school to set up small lab sessions to kindle curiosity and interest in science. More recently, I am designing a curriculum to teach year long to High school students as part of the University's [graduate women in science outreach program](http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wise/pre-college/high_school). More details of my teaching journey can be found [here.](https://niveditharam.github.io/teaching/)


More information on my academic journey can be found in my CV.

Apart from all this, I love theatre, meeting new people, travelling and reading. Feel free to write to me with any questions or opportunities in teaching or theatre that you think will interest me.  -->
